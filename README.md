# nva-verified-funding-sources
This repository contains integrations to verified funding sources and lamda and api-gateway
components for AWS to host a proxy API for these integrations.

Currently, the following integrations are implemented:
- NFR Prosjektbanken APi (/verified-funding/nfr)

Fundings can be queried either by name (lead name) or a generic term. The API supports basic paging.
